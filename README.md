> ðŸ§ª **Note**: This repository is just [NNFS](https://nnfs.io) with added convolution layers + max pooling and basic Le-net architecture implemented for educational purposes. 

### Enhancements

#### Convolutions

- **PyTorch uses `Conv2d` for both grayscale and RGB inputs,so the repo had previously conv2D and conv3D but now its only conv2D.**
- `[batch, channels, height, width]` .
